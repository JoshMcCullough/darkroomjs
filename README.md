DarkroomJS is a JavaScript library which provides basic image editing tools in
your browser, such as **rotation** or **cropping**. It is based on the awesome
[FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com/) library to handle images in HTML5 canvas.

## Demo

Try the online demo at [mattketmo.github.io/darkroomjs](https://mattketmo.github.io/darkroomjs/)

## Usage

Simply instanciate a new Darkroom object with a reference to the image element:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" id="target">
<script>
var dkrm = new Darkroom('#target', {
  // Visible canvas
  workingDrawer: {
    minWidth: 100,
    minHeight: 100,
    maxWidth: 500,
    maxHeight: 500,
  },

  // Plugins options
  plugins: {
    crop: {
      minHeight: 50,
      minWidth: 50,
      ratio: 1,
    },
    custom: function(darkroom) {
      /* Custom plugin initialization */
    }
  }
});

// Post initialization callback
dkrm.initialized.then(function() {
  // Active crop selection
  dkrm.plugins['crop'].requireFocus();

  // Add custom listener
  dkrm.events('transformation', function(payload) { /* ... */ });
});
</script>
```

## The concept

The library is designed to be easily extendable. The core script only transforms
the target image to a canvas with a FabricJS instance, and creates an empty toolbar.
All the features are then implemented in separate plugins.

Each plugin is responsible for creating its own functionality.
Buttons can easily be added to the toolbar and binded with those features.

## Contributing

Run `npm develop` to build and watch the files while developing.

## FAQ

#### How can I access the edited image?

In order to get the edited image data, you must ask the canvas for it.
By doing so inside the callback of your choice (in this case save),
you can assign the edited image data to wherever you please.

```javascript
save: {
  callback: function() {
    this.darkroom.selfDestroy(); // Cleanup
    var newImage = dkrm.canvas.toDataURL();
    fileStorageLocation = newImage;
  }
}
```
